# Case Study

This case study walks you through Parameters Analyzer using synthetic data from a plastic injection process.

# User Story

As a **process engineer**, you design processes and equipment, monitor through testing, and provide strategic oversight. You want to use data analytics to identify trends and improvement areas to make informed decisions about process efficiency.

As a **quality engineer**, you inspect and evaluate products for durability, function, and quality. You need a simple application to find insights on recent production results, understand the impact of parameter changes, and better grasp overall process behavior.

# Data

The data in this application comes from synthetic datasets modeled on a **plastic injection process**. These datasets simulate real production scenarios, capturing key parameters, outputs, and variability.

For detailed information about the data structure and field definitions, see the [Data Model](article:1) page.

# Insights

**Parameters Analyzer** helps you uncover the most impactful parameters on a specified target and identify optimal tuning ranges based on historical data.

Using synthetic plastic injection process data, the application shows you how to:

1. Identify key factors driving your target outcome
2. Extract actionable insights from past tunings and configurations
3. Find improvements to enhance production quality and efficiency

This approach ensures you can quickly apply insights to your real production data.
